# Pp{Chat}
Chat app using React, React-router, Socket.io, Express and Redux.
Made only for training purposes.
Still in development.

Redux at the moment serves no purpose, but will get to that in a while.

## Features
* New design
* Login with username
* Links in chat ([react-linkify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-linkify))
* Appending messages
* Anti-spam
* Client-side timestamps
* Auto-scroll
* Some random names as default
* Users list

## Known issues:
* No integration with localStorage/cookies/session (You'll have to log in every time)
* Logout not implemented
* Users list won't update
* RHS for mobile not yet implemented
* Autoscroll works even when you scroll up ðŸ˜¡

## TODO:
